# avl_tree_implementation
Self - Balancing Binary Search Trees are height - balanced binary search trees that automatically keeps height as small as possible when insertion and deletion operations are performed on tree.The height is typically maintained in order of Log n so that all operations take O(Log n) time on average.
Most of the BST operations (e.g., search, max, min, insert, delete.. etc) take O(h) time where h is the height of the BST. The cost of these operations may become O(n) for a skewed Binary tree. If we make sure that the height of the tree remains O(log(n)) after every insertion and deletion, then we can guarantee an upper bound of O(log(n)) for all these operations. The height of an AVL tree is always O(log(n)) where n is the number of nodes in the tree.
